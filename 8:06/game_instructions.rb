# 2. Would You Like to Play a Game?
#
# Using all your Ruby object prowess, design a playable game.
# You should use at least 4 classes, at least 2 of which are
# subclasses of a single parent.
#
# Ideas:
#
# * Adapt liberally from the rougelike presented in class
# * Design a racing game, with different classes of cars that
#   have different speeds and abilities.
